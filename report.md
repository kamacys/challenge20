## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to calculate loan risk to borrowers. Financial information includes 
loan size, interest rate of the loan, the borrower’s income, the ratio of the borrower’s debt to income, number of borrower accounts, derogatory marks, and the borrower’s total debt. The stages of the machine learning process are: splitting the training and testing data. 



## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:Original data
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy-  95.2%
                           Precision- 92%
                           Recall score- 95%



* Machine Learning Model 2:Resampled data
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy-99.5%
                           Precision- 99%
                           Recall score-99%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
Based on accuracy, machine learning model 2, the resampled data, works best at 99% accuracy.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
